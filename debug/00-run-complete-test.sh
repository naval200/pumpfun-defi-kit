## Test Summary
- **Date**: $(date)
- **Duration**: ${DURATION} seconds
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## Test Phases
1. ✅ **Setup Phase**: Created 20 user wallets, funded 10 with tokens
2. ✅ **Send and Sell Test**: 10 transfer operations between wallets
3. ✅ **Batched Instructions Test**: Mixed operations in single transaction
4. ✅ **Comprehensive Test**: Mixed operations (transfers, sells, AMM)

## Configuration
- **Token Mint**: $(jq -r '.mint' "$WALLETS_DIR/token-info-1756564695373.json")
- **Treasury Wallet**: $(solana-keygen pubkey "$WALLETS_DIR/treasury-wallet.json")
- **Creator Wallet**: $(solana-keygen pubkey "$WALLETS_DIR/creator-wallet.json")
- **User Wallets**: 20 created, 10 funded

## Generated Files
- User wallets: \`debug/user-wallets/\`
- Batch operations: \`debug/batch-operations-test.json\`
- Comprehensive operations: \`debug/comprehensive-batch-test.json\`
- Buy and SOL transfer operations: \`debug/buy-and-sol-transfer-test.json\`
- Detailed logs: \`debug/batch-test-*.log\`, \`debug/buy-sol-transfer-test-*.log\`

## Test Results
- **Send and Sell Test**: 10 transfer operations ✅
- **Batched Instructions**: 10 mixed operations in single transaction ✅
- **Comprehensive Batch**: 16 mixed operations ✅
- **Fee Payer**: Treasury wallet used for all operations ✅
- **Parallel Execution**: max-parallel=5 (send/sell), max-parallel=1 (batched), max-parallel=3 (comprehensive) ✅
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed operations ✅

## What Was Tested
- Wallet creation and token distribution
- Batch transfer operations between user wallets
- Mixed operation types in single batch
- Token buying via bonding curve and AMM
- SOL transfers between wallets
- Combined buy and transfer operations
- Single fee payer for all operations
- Parallel execution and error handling
- Comprehensive logging and reporting

## Next Steps
- Review generated log files for detailed execution info
- Check Solana explorer for transaction details
- Verify token balances in user wallets
- Test with different operation combinations
- Scale up to larger batch sizes
