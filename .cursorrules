# PumpFun Solana Development Rules

## Project Overview
This is a PumpFun token creation and trading experiment on Solana devnet using TypeScript.

## Key Technologies
- **PumpFun SDK**: @pump-fun/pump-swap-sdk for token creation and trading
- **Solana Kit**: @solana/kit for modern Solana interactions
- **Devnet**: All operations should target Solana devnet
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing and modern ES6+ features

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Prefer async/await over promises
- Use proper error handling with try/catch
- Include comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Use meaningful variable names
- Follow Solana best practices for transaction handling

## Architecture Patterns
- Separate concerns: token creation, trading, utilities
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper logging and error reporting
- Handle Solana network congestion with dynamic priority fees
- Support both bonding curve and AMM trading modes

## Key Concepts
- **Bonding Curve**: Mathematical formula for token pricing
- **AMM**: Automated Market Maker for liquidity
- **Priority Fees**: Dynamic calculation based on network conditions
- **Devnet**: Solana's development network for testing

## File Structure
- `src/` - Source code
- `cli/` - Executable scripts
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `config/` - Configuration files

## Solana Specific
- Always use proper commitment levels
- Handle RPC rate limiting gracefully
- Implement proper transaction confirmation
- Use recent blockhash for transactions
- Consider network congestion when setting fees

## Testing
- Test on devnet before mainnet
- Use proper test wallets
- Validate all transaction outcomes
- Test both success and failure scenarios
